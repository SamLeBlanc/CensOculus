*(still in beta until the release of 2020 Census data in ~August)*

## What is CensusMapper?
CensusMapper is a browser-based, interactive mapping application used to visualize the results of the [United States Census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_census). Developed with [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gljs), CensusMapper empowers users to create complex data visualizations perfectly tailored to fit their needs.

## Why CensusMapper?

Three words: versatility, usability, and speed. CensusMapper is highly adaptive, suitable for use in political campiaigns, marketing, industry, community planning, and much more. CensusMapper provides access to many thousands of variables collected by the Census Bureau, including data relating to age, race, sex, ethnicity, housing, rurality, and more. Each categoty is viewable across many levels of geography, down to block group granularity, without compromising computational efficiency. 

## Getting Started

Visit our [Github Page](https://samleblanc.github.io/Census-Mapper/) or clone the repository with
`$ git clone https://github.com/SamLeBlanc/Census-Mapper`.

## 2020 Data

Currently, the project only displays data collected from the 2010 Census. With the expected release of the 2020 census data in August 2021, our goal is to have the 2020 data available within a week of release.
