## What is CensOculus?
CensOculus is a browser-based, interactive mapping application used to visualize the results of the [United States Census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_census). Developed with [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gljs), CensOculus empowers users to create complex data visualizations perfectly tailored to fit their needs.

## Why CensOculus?

Versatility. Usability. Speed. CensOculus is highly adaptive, suitable for use in political campiaigns, marketing, industry, community planning, and much more. CensOculus provides access to thousands of variables tallied by the Census Bureau, including data relating to age, race, sex, ethnicity, housing, rurality, and more. Each categoty is viewable across many levels of geography, down to block group granularity, without compromising overall efficiency.

## 2020 Data
