(still in beta)

Census Mapper is an browser-based, interactive mapping application used to visualize the results of the United States Census. Using mainly [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gljs), users can construct personalized data visualizations perfectly tailored to fit their needs.

This project is highly versatile, suitable for use in political campiaigns, marketing, industry, community planning, and much more. Census Mapper provides access to nearly all of the many thousands of variables tallied by the Census Bureau every decade. This includes data relating to age, race, sex, ethnicity, housing, rurality, and more across multiple levels of geography.
